# Understanding the P-value

The P-value is one important yet often confusing concept in statistics, today I will be delving into it using layman's terms.

Before doing any hardcore statistics gymnastics, let's consider an example: 

as a "blameless" human being, I consistently maintain that I almost always arrive in class on time, of course, with the exception of that "one" time where I am unfashionably late due to the rain and "uncontrollable factors". Seeing me coming to class late again, my statistics professor challenged my firm-held mental belief and said I always come to class around 10 min late. To that I said, “yes, however, even someone who consistently show up on time can be late once or twice, you cannot just use this one time I’m late to reject my perfect stellar record!”
